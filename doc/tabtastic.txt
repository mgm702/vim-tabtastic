USAGE                        *Tabtastic*

This plugin was built as a tool to help create multiple 
tabs in Vim. Often times it can be annoying to create 
many tabs in Vim and this plugin is here to help with 
that. This plugin is easy to use and effectively 
eliminates the work done by the user. 

MAPPING                      *TabtasticMapping*

                The following command will run the 
                Tabtastic plugin. This command will 
:Tabtastic      start a prompt that will quickly create 
                multiple tabs, which you can either 
                load or keep empty. 


This command can also be remapped to use a leader key. The
